# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Cole.

I'm a university student passionate about software engineering and computer science.

## Projects

My main focus right now is [Strafe Stryker](https://github.com/Strafe-Stryker-Development/), a semi-private AI-powered moderation bot. Beyond that, I enjoy working on a variety of TypeScript-adjacent projects.

## Tech Stack

TypeScript is my primary programming language. I love using it with frameworks like Next.js and Svelte, and tools such as Drizzle ORM, Sass, and Vite. As for databases, I have experience with pretty much all of them, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, SQLite, and Cassandra.
