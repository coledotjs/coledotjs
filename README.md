# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Cole.

I'm a university student passionate about software engineering and computer science.

## Projects

My main focus right now is [Strafe Stryker](https://strafestryker.pw), a semi-private AI-powered moderation bot. Beyond that, I enjoy working on a variety of TypeScript-adjacent projects.

## Tech Stack

TypeScript is my primary language of choice; if it can be built with TypeScript, it will be. 

For frontend stuff, I primarily work with React, Next.js, and Svelte, styled using Tailwind CSS, and bundled with Vite. As for the backend, I love using tools like Convex, Drizzle, and Prisma. I don't have a top pick when it comes to databases, but I primarily use PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Redis, MongoDB, and Cassandra.

Yeah, there's a lot TypeScript.
