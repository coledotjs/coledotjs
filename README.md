# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Cole.

I'm a university student passionate about software engineering and computer science.

## Projects

My main focus right now is [Strafe Stryker](https://strafestryker.pw), a semi-private AI-powered moderation bot. Beyond that, I enjoy working on a variety of TypeScript-adjacent projects.

If it can be built with TypeScript, it will be. For frontend stuff, I primarily work with React, Next.js, and Svelte, styled using Tailwind CSS & Sass. As for the backend, I love using tools like Convex, Drizzle, and Prisma. While I don't have a top pick when it comes to databases, I primarily use PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Redis, MongoDB, and Cassandra.
