TypeScript & OSS fanatic. I build whatever sounds like a good idea at 3 AM — mostly tools no one asked for, side projects I’ll never finish, or frameworks that already exist (but mine has a supposedly cooler name). My stack is all over the place, but usually includes things like Next.js, Svelte, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, and MySQL — basically anything that lets me overengineer a todo app.

I love going to coffee shops and pretending I’m being productive. Sometimes I write clean code, other times I write code just that *works*. Either way, most of it ends up open source so feel free to steal or bully me about it.
